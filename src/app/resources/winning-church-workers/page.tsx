                    Many Workers in the church are more committed to their secular jobs than to their Christian ministries. The reason for this is not far-fetched. Their wrong perception of who God is and lack of proper orientation on the assignment they have, continue the main problem.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This book has adequately addressed these problems. It portrays Christians and especially Church Workers as athletes who are running the race set before them by God with the mandate to win the race. The kind of race is that of purpose in destiny that has to be discovered because life purpose is not a personal decision but a personal discovery.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The book presents specific functions of different Church Workers and Leaders in details thereby making it a manual to guide them in their functions. It also gives the details of how Workers can transform their potentials to excellence so that their work for the Lord may be done excellently.
